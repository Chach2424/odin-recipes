        <li>1 teaspoon white vinegar</li>
        <li>some salt to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Put beef and garlic in a large pot. Cover with cold water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer until beef is tender. Remove beef from pot, keep about 5 cups of the cooking liquid and discard the garlic. Let meat cool slightly then shred  with forks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While you're doing that, put corn husks in a large container and cover with warm water. Weigh them down and soak until they are soft.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Toast the ancho chiles in a skillet. Let cool, and then remove any stems and seeds. Grind them any way you like, e.g. mortar and pestle.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Heat some oil in a large skillet. Stir in flour and let it brown slightly. Pour in the beef broth and stir until the mix is smooth. Mix in garlic, ground chiles, cumin seeds, oregano, ground cumin, red pepper flakes, vinegar, and salt. Stir shredded beef into the mix and then cover. Allow it to simmer for about 40 minutes.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Put lard and salt in a mixing bowl. Beat with a mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add masa harina and beat at low speed until it's all mixed well. Gradually pour in the cooking liquid you kept from step 1, until the mix has the consistency of soft cookie dough.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Drain the corn husks. Flatten out each husk one by one, and spread about 2 tablespoons masa mixture onto the top 2/3 of the husk. Lay about 1 tablespoon of meat down the middle of the masa. Roll up the husk starting and fold the ends, then tie it up with some twine.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Put tamales in a steamer basket and steam until masa is firm. Add more water if needed.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
